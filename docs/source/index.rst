The :mod:`torchgan` package consists of various generative adversarial networks and utilities that have been found useful in training them. This package provides an easy to use API which can be used to train popular GANs as well as develop newer variants. The core idea behind this project is to facilitate easy and rapid generative adversarial model research.
